# The Replicant TodoMVC Example

An implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app using the [Replicant](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant) library. You can try the app here:
* https://anteoas.github.io/replicant-todomvc/

***Replicant***: _A native [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) virtual DOM renderer - render hiccup directly_

Replicant is a Clojure and ClojureScript library. Working with it has many similarities with React, but it is not using React and thus not depending on React and everything that React depends on. In fact Replicant has zero/zilch/no dependencies at all.

The example shows a way (of infinitely many) to wire up a Replicant app, with a focus on keeping the views as pure data. We can do this because replicant supports pure data dom event handlers and vdom lifecycle hooks.

To understand a bit of where Replicant comes from, please watch Christian Johansen's talk at JavaZone 2023, [Stateless, Data-driven UIs](https://2023.javazone.no/program/85f23370-440f-42b5-bf50-4cb811fef44d).

## General implementation notes

As stated above, Replicant is a library. It is _not a framework_. It only concerns itself with rendering to the DOM (from its own variant of [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)), implementing a very efficient virtual DOM. While rendering, Replicant helps with dispatching DOM events and lifecycle hooks to the app. The app needs to implement an event handler. From there, Replicant has no further requirements. You can say that Replicant is satisfied with requiring you to work in functional and data-oriented way.

When dispatching events, Replicant allows to dispatch data instead of functions. It allows functions too, but we are using the data oriented approach in this app. This keeps our views not only pure functions, but also fully serializable. We arrange the data from the events in vectors of `actions`, where each `action` also is a vector, with the first element being the action name, and the rest is action arguments.

### The event handler

Replicant will provide our event handler with our event data (`actions`), plus some information about the event itself. We use this information to ‚Äúenrich‚Äù the event data, so that our action handlers have information about things like the event source and the event target.

From there, the event handler is just a simple dispatcher, dispatching on the action name. An action handler can update the app state, and any other side effects. When all actions of an event are handled, we ask Replicant to render the app, providing the current state. If the state has not changed, Replicant will do no re-rendering.

The event handler is the only place (with one exception) where we allow side effects. This is our imperative shell. The exception is the app start, where we initialize the app state, the router, and Replicant.

### The actions

Actions can be big and monolithic or small and composable. It can be any mix in an application. In this example, we try to stay with the composable approach. Implementing some primitive actions, we can compose more complex event handlers.

### Persistence

The app starts with reading any peristed state from local storage, using a default state if there is nothing persisted.

The event handler takes care of persisting the relevant parts of the app state to local storage.

### The views

The views are pure functions that return Hiccup (Clojure vectors representing the DOM). The functions have no local state (and don't use any globel state either), operating only on the data provided to them. The views are part of the application's functional core.

Replicant calls the top view with the app state, and that view then calls all the other views in a cascade. In development you can evaluate any subview in the REPL, while iterating on it, and examine what data (Hiccup) it returns. Since there is no local or global state, all you need to do is prvide enough data to the view. You can also write tests for the views. Hiccup is super easy to inspect.

### Routing

We use [Reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) for routing. The route table is pure data, and the router dipatches `actions` (pure data, remember?) for our event handler.

## Building the app

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (or something node-ish enough)
- [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
- [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)

### Release build

```sh
npm run build
```

### Running the app in development mode

We're using [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) to build the app. Clojure editors like [Calva](https://calva.io) and [CIDER](https://cider.mx/) will let you quickly start the app and connect you to its REPL. You can also just run it without installing anything, by using npx:

```sh
npx shadow-cljs watch :app
```

Once built, you can access the app at http://localhost:8585

To start the app with a Clojure editor friendly nREPL server, run:

```sh
npx shadow-cljs -d cider/cider-nrepl:0.50.2 watch :app
```
