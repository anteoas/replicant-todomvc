# The Replicant TodoMVC Example

An implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app using the [Replicant](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant) library.

***Replicant***: _A native [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) virtual DOM renderer - render hiccup directly_

The example shows a way (of many) to wire up a Replicant app, with a focus on keeping the views as pure data. We can do this because replicant supports pure data dom event handlers and vdom lifecycle hooks.

To understand a bit of where Replicant (and this app example) comes from, please watch Christian Johansen's talk at JavaZone 2023, [Stateless, Data-driven UIs](https://2023.javazone.no/program/85f23370-440f-42b5-bf50-4cb811fef44d).

To understand a bit more about the code in this example, read the more comprehensive README of the [Replicant mini-app](https://github.com/anteoas/replicant-mini-app) example.

## Running the app in development mode

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (or something node-ish enough)
- [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
- [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)

We're using [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) to build the app. Clojure editors like [Calva](https://calva.io) and [CIDER](https://cider.mx/) will let you quickly start the app and connect you to its REPL. You can also just run it without installing anything, by using npx:

```sh
npx shadow-cljs watch :app
```

Once built, you can access the app at http://localhost:8585


To start the app with a Clojure editor friendly nREPL server, run:

```sh
npx shadow-cljs -d cider/cider-nrepl:0.50.2 watch :app
```
